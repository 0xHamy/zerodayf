# üåü Introduction
> Zerodayf is an advanced code analysis platform that leverages artificial intelligence to identify vulnerabilities within source code. 

The system differentiates itself by offering a flexible approach to code analysis, enabling security professionals and developers to utilize their preferred AI models for comprehensive code evaluation beyond traditional vulnerability detection.

Zerodayf was created by a vulnerability researcher to make the process of 0day hunting easier in open-source web apps. Now, developers and hackers can outsource the entire process of code analysis to AI.

_**Pelase note Zerodayf is still in beta testing mode.**_


## üí° Tutorial
Please watch the following demo to understand usage:
![Demo](./app/docs/zerodayf-demo.gif)

## ‚ú® Features
1. Raw proxy logging & beautified logging
2. Capturing start and end line ranges for mapped code
3. Viewing code and highlighting affected code
4. Ability to create multiple custom scan templates
5. Ability to add multiple APIs 
6. Ability to analyse a select number of code files of your choice
7. Ability to view running, completed & failed scans 
8. All scans are saved in the database so you can retain past progress
9. Map Ajax/Fetch API calls in templates to backend API code 

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation with Docker
Deploying Zerodayf via Docker container represents the most efficient implementation method, offering significant advantages over local installation.

To create a container, execute the following command in the Zerodayf root directory:
```bash
sudo docker compose up --build -d
```

Upon successful execution, Zerodayf will be accessible at `127.0.0.1:1337`.

The Docker container configuration implements the following specifications through the `Dockerfile`:
- Python 3.12.3 installation
- Installation of essential dependencies (pandoc, texlive-full, postgresql, etc.)
- Implementation of a database readiness verification script
- Port 1337 exposure for web application access

### Dockerfile Configuration
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12.3

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    pandoc \
    texlive-full \
    postgresql-client \
    netcat-traditional \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app

# Create and add wait-for script
RUN echo '#!/bin/bash\n\
until nc -z localhost 5757; do\n\
  echo "Waiting for database..."\n\
  sleep 2\n\
done\n\
echo "Database is ready!"\n\
exec "$@"' > /wait-for.sh && chmod +x /wait-for.sh

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 1337

CMD ["/wait-for.sh", "uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "1337"]
```

### Docker Compose Configuration
The docker-compose.yaml configuration file requires careful consideration due to its security implications:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    network_mode: "host"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /home:/home:ro
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://test:test@localhost:5757/zerodayf
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: always

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=test
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test
      - POSTGRES_DB=zerodayf
    ports:
      - "5757:5432"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U test -d zerodayf"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Important configuration considerations:
- The `network_mode: "host"` setting grants the Docker container full access to your host network
- Volume configurations enable Docker to access host system files, with read-only (ro) access to the `/home` directory, where projects are expected to reside
- While database credentials can be modified, maintaining default values is recommended unless specifically required

This Docker-based deployment method provides the most streamlined approach to implementing Zerodayf.
