I would also like to express my appreciation to the development teams behind ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek R1, and Claude Sonnet 3.5. Their groundbreaking work in artificial intelligence has enabled individual developers like myself to create sophisticated tools like Zerodayf. Their commitment to advancing AI technology has made it possible to build innovative solutions that contribute to the cybersecurity community.

This project demonstrates how individual developers can leverage cutting-edge AI technology to create meaningful tools for the security and development community.
